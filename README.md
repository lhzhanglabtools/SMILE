# SMILE

## Overview

SMILE is designed for alignment and integration of spatially resolved transcriptomics data.

**a**. SMILE first normalizes the expression proÔ¨Åles for all spots and constructs a spatial neighbor network using the spatial coordinates. SMILE further employs a graph constrastive auto-encoder neural network to extract spatially aware embedding, and align the embeddings by minimazing the distribution of anchors, which are identified by MNN. 
**b**. SMILE can be applied to integrate SRT datasets and scRNA-seq to achieve alignment and simultaneous deconvolution of spots from different biological samples.
